## Authors
DiNT v1.0 (Jul 4 2013): Ahren W. Jasper, C. Melania Oana, and Donald G. Truhlar\

## Functionality
DiNT is a parallel Fortran computer program for performing classical and semiclassical trajectory simulations of electronically adiabatic and nonadiabatic processes.
DiNT - version 2.0 can be used for dynamics governed either by a single potential energy surface (electronically adiabatic processes) or by two or more coupled potential energy surfaces (electronically nonadiabatic processes).
DiNT - version 2.0 can handle reactive trajectories, bimolecular inelastic collisions, and unimolecular processes.
DiNT - version 2.0 can be run at fixed energy or for thermal ensembles.
